# Automated Motivational Emailer
Tips:
- Add your own email credentials & the recipient email address to a .env file located in the directory
- If you don't use gmail, you'll have to edit the send_email function in main.py to have the correct details of your SMTP host (usually found through a quick google search)
- Update quotes.txt to something more personal
